# Spacecraft Survival Game

## Overview

The Spacecraft Survival Game is a Python-based arcade game where players control a spacecraft to navigate through a field of moving obstacles. The objective is to land safely while avoiding collisions and managing limited fuel. The game features dynamic physics, randomized obstacles, and interactive controls.

## Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Randomly generated obstacles with unpredictable movements.
- **Realistic Physics**: Gravity pulls the spacecraft downward, requiring precise control.
- **Fuel Management**: Limited fuel for maneuvering adds a strategic challenge.
- **Wall Wrapping**: Teleport to the opposite side when crossing the screenâ€™s edge.
- **Win/Loss Conditions**: Land safely to win, or crash due to collisions or excessive speed.

## How to Play
- Clone the repository:
  - `git clone https://github.com/tennzzin/spacecraft-game.git`
  - `cd spacecraft-game`
- Run the game:
  - `python spacecraft_game.py`

## Controls
- **Arrow Up**: Thrust upward to counteract gravity.
- **Arrow Left**: Rotate the spacecraft counter-clockwise.
- **Arrow Right**: Rotate the spacecraft clockwise.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Graphics**: Turtle module for 2D rendering.
- **Physics Simulation**: Gravity, velocity, and rotation mechanics.
- **OOP Principles**: Classes for game objects like `SpaceCraft`, `Obstacle`, and `Game`.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Physics Simulation**: Created realistic gravity, velocity, and collision mechanics.
- **Event Handling**: Managed real-time keyboard inputs for dynamic gameplay.
- **Collision Detection**: Implemented logic for obstacle avoidance and successful landing.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Designed modular and reusable code with classes.
